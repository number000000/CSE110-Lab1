## Who am I?
I'm a thrid-year Computer Engineering student in UCSD. I'm from Shenzhen, China. I like playing games (either board games or video games). I've been playing BrawlStars, The Witcher3, Fall Guys, and Hades recently. I'm really looking forward to the new Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom üòä. I also like baking. I've made cookies and cakes. I also indulged myself in bread making. I even tried put together some toast recipes myself.
